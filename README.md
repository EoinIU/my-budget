# MyBudget

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.4. It also makes use of Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB.

## MongoDB Atlas
This app uses MongoDB Atlas in order to persist user data. You should create a free account at https://cloud.mongodb.com and create a database under the free tier. To connect the app to your MongoDB Atlas database use the MongoDB driver for Node.js and copy and paste the connection string into the rest.js file in line 7. Make sure to limit access to your IP address only in network settings in order to keep your data private.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
